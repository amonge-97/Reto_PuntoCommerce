### Step 1: 
Create an API wich recovers all users from a table and returns tha basic data from each user on the response. The respons must be in json format and contntain the following fields (id, name, username, email, and status).

Create anoter endpoint which quantifies each character on the email's field from the table and returns them on descending order by the number of repetitions (Ex: E27, A25, S22). There are no difference in uppercase and lowercase, so both are counted as the same letter and response must be in json format.
